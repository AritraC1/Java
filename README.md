| Console Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game | A Console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java is a simple command-line application where two players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for winning conditions after each move. The program handles player input, displays the updated board after each turn, and announces the winner or a draw when the game concludes.  | A Console-Based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java allows two players to take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, with win, draw, and input validation features. The game continuously updates the board and announces the result after each move.  | Core Java  | Arrays, Control Flow Statements (Loops, Conditionals), Methods, String Manipulation, User Input, Game Logic |
| Library Management System      | A Java-based Library Management System using CRUD operations, OOP principles, and exception handling to efficiently manage books via a console interface.
